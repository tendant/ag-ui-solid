# Test Fixes Summary

All tests are now passing! Here's what was fixed:

## Issues Fixed

### 1. scrollIntoView Not Defined
**Problem:** jsdom doesn't implement `scrollIntoView` method
**Solution:** Added mock in `src/test/setup.ts`:
```typescript
beforeAll(() => {
  Element.prototype.scrollIntoView = () => {};
});
```

### 2. Multiple Elements with Same Placeholder
**Problem:** Test cleanup wasn't properly isolating components between tests
**Solution:** Updated `src/test/utils.tsx` to create fresh containers:
```typescript
export function render(ui: () => JSX.Element, options = {}) {
  const result = solidRender(ui, {
    ...options,
    container: document.body.appendChild(document.createElement('div'))
  });
  return result;
}
```

### 3. Character Counter Test Threshold
**Problem:** Test was checking 8 > 9 (90% of 10), which is false
**Solution:** Updated test to use 19 chars with maxLength of 20:
- 90% of 20 = 18
- 19 > 18, so warning should appear
